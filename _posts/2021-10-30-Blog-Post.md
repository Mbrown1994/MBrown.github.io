## Project Two Discussion

For project two, we took the advice followed in the instructions and
started by using data from one channel. It made the overall process
easier and gave us a better idea as to what our results were going to
look like. It was nice to have a partner for this project because we
were able to bounce ideas and theories off of each other. I’m not sure
that I would do anything differently for this project but I do believe
the most difficult part was using GitHub. It hasn’t been an issue to use
in the past but we worked on the project at the same time so
occasionally we would run into merge conflicts. We were able to resolve
any issues but it did take some time to figure out. I’m not familiar
enough with GitHub to diagnose any issues, especially being able to
diagnose them quickly. I did enjoy the push/pull aspect of GitHub. It
makes it easier to work on things with a collaborator and I can see how
in real world research scenarios, that can become very useful. Utilizing
and getting more familiar with Github was definitely the big take away
for me so I feel like in the future it may be a little easier to use.
