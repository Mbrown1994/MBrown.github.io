## Reflection

+ What (if anything) has changed about what you think a data scientist is and what they do?
I still have this main idea that they transform data utilizing computer sciene but this course definitely strengthened that concept for me. 
Any data scientist needs to have a strong background in programming because some of this stuff is not easy/basic. Overall, nothing has really
changed as far as my idea of a data scientist but I definitely have a special respect for the work that they do.

+ What your current thoughts are in terms of using R for data science - do you think you'll continue to use R going forward?
I will definitely continue to use R and I've actually started implementing in at work. I was worried about this course when I first signed up because
in past classes, R has been difficult for me to understand. This course was exactly what I needed to bring everything full cirle and will help me utilize R 
in the real world. 

+ What things are you going to do differently in practice now that you've had this course?
Just in general, this course helped me better understand how to use R Markdown as well as how to output all of the informatioin to a pdf/html document.
I also have a better understanding on how to format everything nicely and make output more presentable. I will definitely use everything we've learned going 
forward - I thoroughly enjoyed this course and wouldn't change a thing about it!
